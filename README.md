## ðŸŒ± About Me

```html
<!-- You can customize this box with your own styling in future -->
<blockquote>
  I began my journey in programming during high school, fueled by a desire to build impactful software with a purpose. Over time, I discovered a strong creative side, drawn to designâ€”from sketching cars to creating logos, web UIs, and digital posters.

  Today, I'm a Backend Web Development Learner at <strong>ALX</strong>, striving to blend logic and design into elegant, useful systems. Whether itâ€™s a clean backend architecture or a stunning user interface, my goal is to build things that serve communities and inspire creativity worldwide.
